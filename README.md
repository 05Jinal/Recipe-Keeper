The Recipe Management Web Application is a user-friendly platform designed to help users easily manage, store, and share their favorite recipes. 
Built using the Django framework for the backend and HTML/CSS for the frontend, this project enables users to add new recipes, update existing ones, search through stored recipes, and upload images of their culinary creations. 
Users can submit their favorite recipes by providing a name, detailed description, and an image, which will be securely stored and displayed in a structured table format. 
The application also features a convenient edit/update functionality, allowing users to modify any aspect of their recipes, including the name, description, and image. 
Additionally, the search bar makes it easy for users to filter recipes by name, providing a more efficient way to navigate through the stored collection. 
The project utilizes Bootstrap to create a clean, responsive design that works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring a smooth user experience.
With Django's powerful framework managing the server-side logic, file uploads, and database interactions, this project highlights the implementation of basic CRUD operations in web development.
